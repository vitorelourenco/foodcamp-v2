# Foodcamp

![screenshot](./app_screenshot.png)

React-Foodcamp is a single page application in which the user can choose at least one and up to any number of items per category for any number of categories. Once the order is ready to be placed and the 'Fechar pedido' button is clicked, the user is routed to the checkout review screen for reviewing, where they can cancel it or confirm the order and send it through whatsapp using the whatsapp API. The scrollbars that show up in the large screen sizes were a requirement set by others for this project but they can be easily hidden.
